# Fake-Filler

### Fake-Filler main idea is to auto fill forms with random data so developers can test easier
#### Features

| Input types     | Yes/No        |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| textarea        | ✔             |
| text            | ✔             |
| password        | ✔             |
| email           | ✔             |
| number          | ✔             |
| select          | ✔             |
| file            | ❌            |

### Note that it fills the input fields by their types, so sometime the field may be marked as type text but it expects email and won't work.
